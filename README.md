# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java Assignment üöÄ

Welcome to the **OOP in Java** assignment repository! This repository contains exercises and projects focused on mastering object-oriented programming principles in Java. The goal is to provide a strong foundation in OOP, enabling efficient and organized code design.

## üìù Topics Covered

Each section of this assignment introduces key OOP concepts progressively:

1. **Introduction to OOP**: 
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around creating reusable "objects" that combine data and behavior. It focuses on breaking down complex software design into smaller, manageable, and modular components. 
   - In Java, OOP allows developers to create code that is modular, maintainable, and scalable by modeling real-world entities through classes and objects. 
   - This introduction covers why OOP is essential, the benefits it brings to software development, and how Java is particularly suited for OOP due to its structure and built-in support for OOP principles.

2. **Encapsulation**: Implementing private and public access modifiers, getters and setters.
3. **Abstraction**: Abstract classes, interfaces, and hiding unnecessary details.
4. **Inheritance**: Extending classes, superclass-subclass relationships, and reusability.
5. **Polymorphism**: Method overriding, overloading, and dynamic dispatch.
6. **Major Keywords & method**:This & super
